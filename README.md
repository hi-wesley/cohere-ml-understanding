# Cohere ML understanding
## Overview
This repository contains code from a learning session hosted by Ash as part of Cohere Labs' ML understanding:

Join us for an enlightening session exploring [*"An Overview of Early Vision in InceptionV1,"*](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/early-vision/) the next Distill article by Olah et al from the Circuits thread!
Expect a guided tour through “neuron groups” — from classic edge and color detectors to curve, circle, spiral, and even tiny head/eye detectors — all revealing the building blocks of machine vision. The session breaks down how these features are grouped, why early vision circuits are both simple and universal across models, and how understanding them can illuminate broader neural network structure.
